# Tokens

The implementation of these design tokens are based on the [first draft](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) of the official W3C spec.

## Groups
There are three token groups. all with different purposes.

- **Base** - Base values and scales for different types of tokens like color, dimension or duration.
- **Brand** - Tokens or aliasses for the Get Lost brand values.
- **Components** - Mostly aliasses, some tokens that are used in components

## Types
There are only six token types defined in the W3C spec. The full list of types used in these token files are:

| Type | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | - | `"Test"` |
| Number | - | `0.5` |
| Boolean | - | `true` |
| Color | `"color"` | `"#ff0000"` |
| Dimension | `"dimension"` |  `"0.25rem"` |
| Font Name | `"font"` |  `"Avenir Next"` |
| Duration | `"duration"` |  `"200ms"` |
| Cubic BÃ©zier | `"cubic-bezier"` |  `[0.5, 0, 1, 1]` |
